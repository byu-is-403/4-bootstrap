      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p class="lead">I am a student living in Provo, UT. After years of trying to find my course in life, I discovered the Information Systems program and decided to enroll in its prerequisite courses. The more I progressed through those courses, the more I knew applying technology to solve business problems is what I wanted to do.</p>
      <p class="lead">In my free time, I like to make and listen to music. My first passion was playing the drums and it occupied the majority of my time in middle school and high school.</p>
      <p class="lead">After my sophomore year of college, I spent 2 years in Spain. Since returning to the United States, I still enjoy finding time to practice my Spanish and take part in their unique culture. I have travelled to Paris and spent a summer living in Ottawa, Canada. I would love to continue traveling throughout my life.</p>
