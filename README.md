# Landing Page

The purpose of this assignment is to help students understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create modern websites.

### Getting Started
You will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a resume website for yourself. Let's review what these three tools do:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| HTML | HTML stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language". It is the language you will use to define the structure of your page |
| CSS | CSS stands for "Cascading Stylesheets". It is the language you will use to style your page |
| JavaScript | JavaScript is the dynamic language of the web. Despite naming similarities, it has about as much in common with Java as a Carnival does with a Car. It is used to make the web interactive and responsive. |

To begin, open the file included in this repository named `index.html`. `index` is a common name for the home page of a site.
